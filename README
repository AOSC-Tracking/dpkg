dpkg functional test-suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WARNING
-------

This program currently runs as root, and will write to your current root
filesystem. If you are uncertain of the consequences, run it at least on
a chroot, or isolated in a virtual machine.

How to run
----------

After cloning the repository, you will need to run «./db-regen».

There's a brief usage information when invoking “make” on the topdir.

You probably want to use something like eatmydata to run the tests, it
affects the performance significantly.

To use the tools from the dpkg build-tree, set DPKG_BUILDTREE accordingly.

To use a different dpkg series than the current one, set DPKG_SERIES to
something like 1.16.x.

The DPKG_TESTSUITE_OPTIONS environment/make variable can be used to change
the behaviour of the test runs, the following options are currently
supported:

* not-root

  This runs the tests in unprivileged (non-root) mode.

* test-all

  This runs all tests, including manual and failing ones.

* debug

  This makes dpkg print lots of debug output.

The configuration file ‘.pkg-tests.conf’ can be used to set permanent
parameters. For example:

  ,-- .pkg-tests.conf --
  |DPKG_TESTSUITE_OPTIONS := debug not-root
  `--

Test-suite layout
-----------------

The tests are split into logical units, testing a specific characteristic.
To add a new test please check Test.mk and Makefile on the topdir, and some
of the current tests. Patches welcome!

Future plans
------------

There's lots of tests that are still missing, we are adding new ones when
we stumble over regressions, when adding new functionality, and as time
permits for existing functionality.

The idea is for this to eventually be merged into the dpkg git repository
and be run as part of “make check”. Some changes to dpkg would need to be
implemented first.
